#                  Used to correct for offset from center of image

#                  4: proportional correction: i_new = i / corr.
#                       This mode is recommended for use with linear data.
#                       If the input data is gamma corrected, try adding g2.2
#                       to the m line.
#
#                      default is additive correction: i_new = i + corr

#                    Both radial and flatfield correction can be combined with the
#                     proportional correction by adding 4.
#                 Examples: i1 - radial polynomial correction by addition.
#                                 The coefficients j,k,l,o must be specified.

#                                 The flatfield image should be specified with the p option
#
# Va,Vb,Vc,Vd  vignetting correction coefficients. (defaults: 1,0,0,0)
#               ( 0, 2, 4, 6 order polynomial coefficients):
#                corr = ( i + j*r^2 + k*r^4 + l*r^6), where r is the distance from the image center
#              The corrected pixel value is calculated with: i_new = i_old + corr
#              if additive correction is used (default)
#			   for proportional correction (h5): i_new = i_old / corr;
#
# Vx,Vy        radial vignetting correction offset in pixels (defaults Vx0 Vy0, optional).
#                 Used to correct for offset from center of image

#                  Vy - vertical offset
#
# Vf           filename of flatfield image.
#               For additive correction the image will be used as it is.
#               In the case of correction by division, the flatfield will be divided by
#               its mean value.
#
# Ra,Rb,Rc,Rd,Re EMoR photometric model parameters. (defaults: 0,0,0,0,0) 
#

#                       Selection can be outside image dimension.
#                       The selection will be circular for circular fisheye images, and
#                       rectangular for all other projection formats
