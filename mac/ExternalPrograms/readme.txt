External Programs(This is for 10.4 or above)HOWTO:1. Download the source. You typically want to place it in the "ExternalPrograms" folder.2. Edit ExternalPrograms/scripts/SetEnv-*.txt file appropriately, especially the myREPOSITORYDIR variable.3. Open a Terminal window (bash is preferred).5. 'cd' into the directory of source you want to compile. (eg. 'cd ExternalPrograms/jpeg-6b')4. Set the variables for the compilation. (eg. 'source ../scripts/SetEnv-universal.txt')6. Using the appropriate shell script, build the source. (eg. 'sh ../scripts/libjpeg.sh')RESULT:The programs and libraries will be installed into $myREPOSITORYDIR, which you can manage independently from the systems you are currently using (e.g /usr, /usr/local, /opt, /sw).TIPS:When compiling programs from source specifying the above directory as prefix. You probably have to specify the correct SDK (-isysroot) and MacOS target version (-mmacosx-version-min) as well.
You can make multiple 'repositories' as well. For example, you can make one for statically and one for dynamically linked product, or ones with different target architecture/OS versions.
