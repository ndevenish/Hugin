<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Common_error_messages"> Common error messages </span></h2>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="enblend:_no_input_files_specified"> enblend: no input files specified </span></h3>
<p>There are no input images relevant to the output 'panorama' so hugin had nothing to do, probably because all the input images are outside the panorama 'frame' or disabled.  Open the <a href="Hugin_Preview_window.html" title="Hugin Preview window">Hugin Preview window</a> or <a href="Hugin_Fast_Preview_window.html" title="Hugin Fast Preview window">Hugin Fast Preview window</a> to adjust the view, enable some images inside the panorama frame and/or adjust the crop.
</p><p>Note also that hugin versions up to and including 2009.2.0 allow you to draw an inverted crop frame where the top is below the bottom, this is easy to see in the Preview window as the entire panorama is 'greyed'. A crop frame drawn like this will result in an empty panorama and the above error message.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="enblend:_excessive_overlap_detected"> enblend: excessive overlap detected </span></h3>
<p>This is an error new to enblend-4.0.  Photos that nearly entirely overlap won't blend very well, enblend now fails instead of attempting to blend them.  There are various workarounds:
</p>
<ul><li> Follow the error message and remove the suggested image from the set, you probably don't need it to complete the panorama.
</li><li> Switch back to enblend-3.2.
</li><li> Hugin will merge stacked images before blending if you select 'Exposure fusion' in the <a href="Hugin_Stitcher_tab.html" title="Hugin Stitcher tab">Hugin Stitcher tab</a>. This error will go away, but Hugin will take a very different approach to variable exposure between photos.
</li><li> Mask out major parts of one image.
</li></ul>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="enblend:_error_writing_to_image_swap_file"> enblend: error writing to image swap file </span></h3>
<p><a href="Enblend.html" title="Enblend">enblend</a> needs a lot of memory and uses its own swap routine to store picture data on the disk, this message indicates that you have run out of disk space.  The data is stored in the system temp folder which is specified by TMP, TEMP or TMPDIR environment variables, note that this temp folder may be on a different physical disk to your photos and panorama output.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="execvp.28make_....29_failed_with_error_2"> execvp(make ...) failed with error 2 </span></h3>
<p>Hugin requires the 'make' utility to stitch, you need to install it and/or report the problem to whoever supplied Hugin to you.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="false_--compression_NONE"> false --compression NONE </span></h3>
<p>This error is caused by a bug in the 0.7.0 release that is fixed in 0.8.0.  The problem is that your preferences are messed-up, the workaround for 0.7.0 is to go to File -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Enblend and click Load Defaults -&gt; Yes -&gt; Ok
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Enblend_error:_Mask_is_entirely_black.2C_but_white_image_was_not_identified_as_redundant"> Enblend error: Mask is entirely black, but white image was not identified as redundant </span></h3>
<p>This is a well known "error" for <a href="Enblend.html" title="Enblend">enblend</a>. Try to use the additional enblend parameter "--fine-mask" to get rid of the error. The parameter will result in generation of masks in higher resolution that will fix the problem in most cases. Sometimes the "--fine-mask" parameter may result in memory errors (malloc: ...), which are the result of not enough memory available due to the (much) bigger masks that are used.
</p><p>An alternative workaround would be to set the enblend --no-optimize parameter, this will place the seam directly along the middle of the image overlaps regardless of image content.  This option is also considerably faster and uses less memory.
</p><p>This error also occurs when one photo is completely covered by another, try removing redundant photos.
</p><p>Note also that for the same reasons this error often appears when rendering a scene with extreme distortion such as a stereographic 'little planet'. For this and other reasons, such as overall speed, it is always preferable to render a 'normal' 360° <a href="Equirectangular_Projection.html" title="Equirectangular Projection">Equirectangular Projection</a> panorama first, then load this as a single source image into a new project and render whatever views you need.
</p><p>Note (Jan 2010): This should be fixed in the latest <a href="Enblend.html" title="Enblend">enblend</a> 4.0 release.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="enblend:_illegal_option_--_compression"> enblend: illegal option -- compression </span></h3>
<p>hugin 0.7.0 and later versions require at least <a href="Enblend.html" title="Enblend">enblend</a> version 3.2.  This error indicates that you need to upgrade enblend.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="enblend:_Error_-1073741795"> enblend: Error -1073741795 </span></h3>

<p>This is a message generated by nona when using the GPU for stitching (feature available starting with Hugin-2009.2.0). See section below about <a href="Hugin_FAQ.html#GPU-stitching_.28nona.29">GPU-stitching</a>.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="make:_enfuse:_command_not_found"> make: enfuse: command not found </span></h3>
<p>This is a message generated by make when assembling your panorama. It most likely means that enfuse is not on your computer. Enfuse is part of the enblend package, but many Linux distributions, even recent ones, ship with an older version of enblend that does not contain enfuse. You need to install enblend-3.2 or later.

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Windows_error_message_.22application_configuration_is_incorrect.22">Windows error message "application configuration is incorrect"</span></h3>
<p>Double clicking the Hugin icon to run the program produces a message like this:
</p>
<pre>
C:\Program Files\Hugin\bin\hugin.exe
This application has failed to start because the application configuration is incorrect.
Reinstalling the application may fix this problem.

</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Stitching_fails_on_Windows_.28syntax_error.29"> Stitching fails on Windows (syntax error)</span></h3>
<p>If the stitching step fails on windows with a error message like
</p>
<pre>

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Hugin_Quits_.28Seg_Faults.29_at_Launch_.28Linux.29"> Hugin Quits (Seg Faults) at Launch (Linux) </span></h3>
<p>There may be many reasons why a program dies before it has even started.
</p><p>One possibility is bad configuration or installation of the video drivers.  See this <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/hugin/+bug/679427">ticket</a>.  To diagnose, try running glxgears.  On Ubuntu (the package is probably available on most Linux distributions):
</p>
<pre>
sudo apt-get mesa-utils
glxgears
</pre>
<p>If glxgears does not run on your system, Hugin will not run either.  See your Linux distribution's instruction on how to fix the video drivers.

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Known_Limitations"> Known Limitations </span></h2>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Linux:_Compiz"> Linux: Compiz </span></h3>
<p>Linux: Compiz interferes with the <a href="Hugin_Fast_Preview_window.html" title="Hugin Fast Preview window">hugin Fast Preview window</a>. This is not a hugin specific issue. Research shows all direct rendered stuff will have various problems under Compiz: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xorg-server/+bug/96991">https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xorg-server/+bug/96991</a>
</p><p>This problem is fixed with DRI2, e.g with fedora 11 and intel graphics hardware you can have a 'wobbly' Fast Preview window if you really want.
</p><p>It's not an issue with NVidia's proprietry driver.
</p><p>If you're affected, the workaround is to not use Compiz.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Windows:_International_Characters_in_Path"> Windows: International Characters in Path </span></h3>
<p>Hugin is fully internationalised and can cope with special characters in file paths. However, hugin apparently fails on some Windows systems with Polish, Japanese, Russian or Czech codepages, the workaround is to use shell-safe ascii characters in file and folder names: <b>A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 - _ .</b> This includes the path for the temporary folder which is named after your username on Windows systems.
</p><p><br />
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Non-Unique_Filenames"> Non-Unique Filenames </span></h3>
<p>Some components of Hugin have been reported not to deal well with image files
that have the same name in different folders. The workaround is to rename 
your images files so that all image files in a project are unique.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Temporary_Files"> Temporary Files </span></h3>
<p>Hugin has a preference setting for the temporary files folder. Currently it
is not implemented properly and files will be written in the same folder as
the project file.
</p><p>A partial workaround on Linux is to start Hugin from a terminal with
</p>
<pre>
TMPDIR=/media/disk-2/tmp hugin &amp;
</pre>
<p>A workaround on Windows is to create a batch file which sets the temp folder before running Hugin.
eg using notepad, create a file called HuginWithNewTemp.cmd with the following in it:
</p>
<pre>
REM Create a folder on C Drive called Temp for this to work

REM Set the temp file environment variables for hugin
set temp=c:\temp
set tmp=c:\temp

REM run hugin
&quot;C:\Program Files\Hugin\bin\hugin.exe
</pre>
<p><br />
These temporary files have to be deleted manually after the stitch.

<p>Hugin currently does not do plausibility checks on the paths and file names that are given to it. It relies on the operating system's conventions and limitations. However Hugin uses <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_%28software%29">make</a> to run the stitching process, and make has more restrictive limitations than the operating system.
</p><p>Please don't use the above characters in your files and folders when you want to make sure they work with Hugin. If you absolutely need files named this way, rename them after processing. Do not file bug reports based on filenames with the above characters. The <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&amp;atid=550441&amp;aid=2883450&amp;group_id=77506">issue</a> is known, analyzed, and may be fixed in the future.

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Stitch_fails_when_.27.26.27_is_part_of_the_Windows_user-name"> Stitch fails when '&amp;' is part of the Windows <i>user-name</i> </span></h3>
<p>This is a variant of the above, but more difficult to work around.  The <i>user-name</i> is part of all paths in the user's data area, including the temporary file locations defined by TMP and TEMP.  Stitch fails almost immediately with a make path error.
</p><p>Work-around: See the Temporary Folders section above, or Move your hugin data to a folder in the root directory such as C:\hugin.  Then go to the Windows Control Panel and change <i>System, Advanced, Environment, user TMP</i> to a folder in the root, such as 'C:\temp' (create it if necessary).
</p><p>Notes:  On Windows 7 go to Start&gt;Control Panel&gt;User Account&gt;Change my environment variables and change the variables TEMP and TMP accordingly.
</p><p>A simpler solution should be to set hugin <i>File, Preferences, Temporary dir</i> to C:\hugin; but it doesn't fix
the problem! Seemingly, at least one temporary file still gets created in the TMP folder.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Hugin_fails_stitching_some_stereographics_and_other_polar_projections"> Hugin fails stitching some stereographics and other polar projections  </span></h3>
<p>This is a known limitation caused by photos being distorted into extreme 'C' and 'O' shapes. The workaround: stitch all of your pictures into a single equirectangular, and then load the equirectangular into Hugin to generate the stereographic or other projections you wanted to do in the first place.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="OS_X_and_iPhoto"> OS X and iPhoto </span></h3>
<p>Dragging the photos from iPhoto to Hugin works perfectly as long as there is no forward slash in the Name of the events in iPhoto (which translates to folders inside the iPhoto Database).
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="OS_X_10.7_and_Enblend_.2F_Enfuse"> OS X 10.7 and Enblend / Enfuse </span></h3>
<p>When using Hugin on Mac OS X 10.7 <i>Lion</i> with the built-in versions of enblend and enfuse (i.e. those packaged inside the hugin bundle) the stitching process will stop abruptly with an error. See <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/hugin/+bug/814280">bug 814280</a>. The workaround is to use the enblend and enfuse versions for Mac OS X 10.4 <i>Tiger</i> that are inside the dmg in the <i>enblend-enfuse-4.0</i> folder.<br />
<b>Note</b>: Development versions as of version hugin-mac-2011.5.0.<b>5723</b> and newer can be run on Lion as they are. They contain openmp enabled enblend/enfuse binaries that run on Lion.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Fast_Preview"> Fast Preview </span></h3>
<p>Why are there two preview windows, and which one should I use?
</p><p>For most purposes, the newer Fast Preview window is faster.  However it is still under development and sometimes shows artefacts.  The old preview still does a logarithmic tone mapping of stacked
images and is the only way to preview hdr or fused output.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Makefile_based_stitching_process"> Makefile based stitching process </span></h3>
<p>Can I restart a stitching process that was interrupted manually or by an error without starting everything from scratch?
</p><p>Unfortunately the Hugin Makefile system only supports restarting if you stitch on the command-line.  The GUI tools always create new temporary .pto project and Makefile files every time they stitch, so this forces make to recreate everything for every stitch.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Patching_nadir_shots_using_XYZ_mosaic_mode_cuts_the_photos_in_half"> Patching nadir shots using XYZ mosaic mode cuts the photos in half </span></h3>
<p>"If an image is mapped to the <a href="Nadir.html" title="Nadir">nadir</a> of a panorama and all translation parameters (X,Y,Z) are set to zero, the image is properly mapped and covers the entire nadir of the shot. However, if any of the X,Y,Z parameters are non-zero, then the image is cut in half and only occupies half of the nadir."
</p><p>Basically the XYZ mosaic mode as it is implemented currently in <a href="Hugin.html" title="Hugin">Hugin</a> requires that the mosaic photos must be mapped to a plane perpendicular to the view direction - In practice this means that what you are trying to do only works if the panorama is rotated such that the nadir is in the middle of the canvas and not at the bottom.
</p><p>This isn't so bad, the nadir-in-the-middle image looks a bit weird, you can just reload the stitched <a href="Equirectangular_Projection.html" title="Equirectangular Projection">equirectangular Projection</a> result into a new single-photo project and straighten it there.

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Python_Scripting"> Python Scripting </span></h2>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="What_is_Python_Scripting.3F"> What is Python Scripting? </span></h3>
<p>Python is a powerful scripting language.  Starting with Hugin 2011.2, Hugin exposes the panorama object through hsi.py in Python.  It must be explicitly activated at build time with the CMake boolean parameter -DBUILD_HSI:BOOL=ON.  It is currently untested / unavailable on OS X.

<p>Strictly speaking, they are both Python scripts.  A Plugin runs inside Hugin, while a Script runs in a shell or desktop.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Where_Are_the_Plugins_in_Hugin_and_how_do_I_use_them.3F"> Where Are the Plugins in Hugin and how do I use them? </span></h3>
<p>If Hugin was compiled with HSI, a menu Action will list categories of system-wide plugins.  Just select one to run it.  Moreover, you can write your own plugins and run them with the menu Edit -&gt; Run User Python Plugin.  The default location for user plugins is set in the preferences.

<p>Some actions only work with specific versions of Hugin or operating systems.

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Control_Point_creation"> Control Point creation </span></h2>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="How_do_I_add_control_points"> How do I add control points </span></h3>
<p>The <a href="Control_points.html" title="Control points">control points</a> editor is quite powerful, but its usage is probably not obvious on the first try. Here are some ways the developers use the Control Point panel:
</p><p>1. Selecting control points in 100% zoom.
</p><p>This method needs some scrolling, if big images are used. You might want to try the fit to window zoom setting in that case. Switch to the Control Points tab, and use the following settings:
</p>
<pre>Zoom: 100%
[X] auto fine tune
[X] auto add
[X] auto estimate
</pre>
<p>Click on a prominent feature in the left image. If the image pair already contains control points, <a href="Hugin.html" title="Hugin">hugin</a> will try to select the point in the other image. If its the first point in this pair, click near the same feature on the right image. The second point will be placed and fine tuned automatically. If you are not happy with the placement, both points can be moved by dragging them to a better position. Press the "f" key to fine tune the point in a small area.
</p><p><br />
2. Selecting control points in fit to window mode.
</p><p>I uses this mode if I need to set points on big images. Switch to the Control Points tab, and use the following settings:
</p>
<pre>Zoom: fit to window
[X] auto fine tune
[ ] auto add
[X] auto estimate
</pre>
<p>Click on left image. The image will be shown in 100% view. Within the detailed view, click on a prominent feature. If the image pair already contains control points, hugin will try to select the point in the other image. If its the first point in this pair, click near the same feature on the right image. The point will be placed and fine tuned automatically. If you are not happy with the placement, both points can be moved by clicking at the desired position. Move the point close to the desired feature and press the "f" key to fine tune the point. When the points are on the same feature, press the right mouse button, or press the "a" key to add the control point pair. It will then be shown in the list below the image.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="How_do_I_scroll_both_images_at_the_same_time.3F"> How do I scroll both images at the same time? </span></h3>
<p>Try pressing the shift key while moving the mouse. The control key or the middle mouse button can be used to scroll only the image under the mouse cursor.

<p>The <i>preview window</i> updates continuously whenever anything changes, so disable the preview auto-update, close it or make it smaller if you don't need it.

<p>Cpfind is a recent addition to the Hugin suite and its parameters still require some fine tuning.  Unlike older CP generators used with Hugin, it depends on information passed in the PTO file.  Make sure that your input project file contains reasonable information about the used lens.  If you are using a fisheye or wide angle lens, try increasing the parameters --sieve1width --sieve1height --sieve1size.  A combinations that may work is "--sieve1width 50 --sieve1height 50 --sieve1size 300".  Sometimes also the option "--fullscale" might help.

<p>The rotation of photos in the <a href="Hugin_Control_Points_tab.html" title="Hugin Control Points tab">Hugin Control Points tab</a> isn't necessarily
related to the orientation of the files themselves.
</p><p>Hugin shows photos at the angle they best fit into the panorama, so if the
panorama fit is bad, then you will see strange angles in the Control Points
tab. Probably the problem is caused by bad alignment, you can
identify 'bad' <a href="Control_points.html" title="Control points">Control points</a> in the <a href="Hugin_Control_Points_table.html" title="Hugin Control Points table">Hugin Control Points table</a>, delete them and re-optimise.

<p>If you copy a .pto project to a different folder and open it with hugin, you will be prompted for the 'missing' images.  You should delete any control points from this template project since they won't be relevant to the new photos.

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="How_do_I_straighten_a_curved_horizon.3F"> How do I straighten a curved horizon? </span></h3>
<p>If the panorama looks nice but the horizon is curved, there are various ways to improve the image and straighten the horizon.
</p><p>First, try clicking the <b>Straighten</b> button in the <a href="Hugin_Fast_Preview_window.html" title="Hugin Fast Preview window">Hugin Fast Preview window</a>.
</p><p>If this doesn't work then you can use the Move/Drag tab of the <a href="Hugin_Fast_Preview_window.html" title="Hugin Fast Preview window">Hugin Fast Preview window</a> to visually straighten the panorama, drag the photos with the mouse, use the right mouse button to rotate.  One useful tip is to drag the panorama so a vertical feature is in the middle, rotate it so the feature lines up with the 'cross hair', then drag the panorama up or down until all the vertical features in the scene are vertical on the screen (holding down the shift key while dragging limits the motion to just up/down or left/right).
</p><p>If it is still curved, you have to add vertical guide control points in the "Control Points" tab. Usually two <a href="Vertical_control_points.html" title="Vertical control points">vertical control points</a> are enough to straighten the horizon nicely. Often edges of buildings, poles or other man made structures provide good vertical lines. To add a vertical control point, switch to the control point editor and select the same image on both sides. Place a control point on the left image on the upper area of the vertical feature. In the right image, select a control point on the lower area of the features, and press the Add button. Once the new point has been added, its type should automatically switch to "vertical line". You might want to switch off the auto-add and auto-estimate options while doing this to avoid naggy dialogs while adding these guide points. Two points that are roughly 90 degrees apart provide the best effect.

<p>Hugin uses the first photo as the <i>anchor</i> image and puts it in the middle by default.  This means that if you shot a sequence from left to right, the images will fill the right hand side of the panorama.  There are three ways to fix this:
</p>
<ul><li> Open the <b>preview</b> window and click the <b>center</b> button.
</li><li> or select the middle photo, hit <b>anchor this image for position</b> and <b>reset</b> in the <b>images</b> tab, then reoptimise.
</li><li> In the 'Fast Panorama Preview' window select 'Drag'. Left mouse drags the image, right mouse rotates the image.

<p>If the banding looks like posterization<a class="external" href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterization">[*]</a> then this is likely due to a error with estimation of the <a href="Camera_response_curve.html" title="Camera response curve">camera response curve</a>.  To get an accurate response curve, Hugin needs significant <a href="Vignetting.html" title="Vignetting">vignetting</a> and/or <a href="Bracketing.html" title="Bracketing">bracketed exposures</a>. The workaround is to <b>Reset...</b> the <b>Camera Response</b> in the Hugin Camera and Lens tab<a class="external" href="http://wiki.panotools.org/Hugin_Camera_and_Lens_tab">[*]</a> and stitch again - <a href="Hugin.html" title="Hugin">Hugin</a> usually produces acceptable results for a simple panorama when the camera response parameters are all zero.
</p><p>If there is a wave of light and dark patches in the sky this could be due to <a href="Vignetting.html" title="Vignetting">vignetting</a> in the source photos, you can deal with this by optimising <b>Vignetting (Vb, Vc, Vd)</b> in the <a href="Hugin_Exposure_tab.html" title="Hugin Exposure tab">Hugin Exposure tab</a>.  Another workaround is to increase the number of <a href="Enblend.html" title="Enblend">enblend</a> blending levels, try setting '-l 29' as the enblend <b>Command line options</b> in the <a href="Hugin_Stitcher_tab.html" title="Hugin Stitcher tab">Hugin Stitcher tab</a>.

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="My_photos_never_quite_line_up.2C_what_can_I_do.3F"> My photos never quite line up, what can I do? </span></h3>
<p>It is normal to get little stitching <a href="Parallax.html" title="Parallax">parallax</a> errors if
the camera moves between photos.  The solution is to rotate the camera around
the <a href="No-parallax_point.html" title="No-parallax point">no-parallax point</a> using a panoramic head<a class="external" href="http://wiki.panotools.org/Heads">[*]</a> or philopod<a class="external" href="http://wiki.panotools.org/Philopod">[*]</a>.
</p><p>Otherwise you can sometimes improve things by optimising the <i>d &amp; e</i> parameters
separately - When you optimise <b>everything</b>, unselect <b>Inherit</b> in
the <b>camera and Lens</b> panel for 'd &amp; e'. Also you can open the control point window sort it by distance and check the ones large distance.
</p><p>If these parallax errors are still large, you need to decide which
parts of the scene that you want to line-up and which parts don't
matter.  Select <a href="Control_points.html" title="Control points">control points</a> only on objects that you do want to
line-up and which are all about the same distance from the camera.
</p><p>The remaining broken lines can then be retouched in a photo editor like the gimp<a class="external" href="http://wiki.panotools.org/Gimp">[*]</a>.
The <i>shear</i> tool is ideal for bending the lines and
getting them to line up<a class="external" href="http://wiki.panotools.org/Mending_parallax_errors_with_the_shear_tool">[*]</a>.

<p>Manually enter the values for <a href="Yaw.html" title="Yaw">yaw</a> and <a href="Pitch.html" title="Pitch">pitch</a> for each of the photos.

</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Can_I_stitch_my_HDR_images_.3F"> Can I stitch my HDR images&#160;? </span></h3>
<p>Yes. If you already have merged your HDR stacks, follow the <b>Normal</b> Output on the <b>Stitcher</b> tab (<b>HDR merging</b> is for stacks that will be merged by Hugin). In the <b>Processing</b> step the output will be an HDR in TIFF format.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Why_is_my_panorama_upside_down_.3F"> Why is my panorama upside down&#160;? </span></h3>
<p>Hugin stitches the panorama on a sphere and can't determine what is up or what is down. Even if vertical control points are assigned, there is still no notion of up and down, so the panorama can flip upside down. The solution for that is to open the Preview window, click on the Num. Trans. button in the toolbar, enter 180 in the roll field and apply. This will flip the panorama back to the right orientation.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Why_do_multi-lens_projects_end_up_distorted.2Fbroken.3F"> Why do multi-lens projects end up distorted/broken? </span></h3>
<p>You have probably optimized 'Everything'. This will cause the optimizer to try to optimize lens parameters for each of the different lenses, and there may not be a big enough spread of control points for the optimization to work well.
When stitching photos from different lenses, or when you don't have a good spread of control points, optimize 'Position, view &amp; Barrel (y,p,r,v,b).
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Why_does_my_output_covers_only_180.C2.B0.3F"> Why does my output covers only 180°? </span></h3>
<p>Did you observe that the output is cropped at the +-90° borders? (e.g. saw teeth like borders in the fast preview window)
</p><p>Then you have probably used the translation parameters X/Y/Z. This behaviour is a fundamental limitation of the used approach of the translation parameters. It is (internal) working in the rectilinear space, which is limited to maximal FOV of 180°, and therefore also the output is limited to FOV&lt;180° (for more information see <a href="Stitching_a_photo-mosaic.html" title="Stitching a photo-mosaic">Stitching a photo-mosaic</a>).
</p><p>The solution/workaround is to set all X/Y/Z values to zero or to limit the horizontal field of view (HFOV) to a value smaller than 180°.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="GPU-stitching_.28nona.29"> GPU-stitching (nona) </span></h2>
<p>Starting with Hugin-2009.2 nona has a new, experimental feature: it can use the video card (GPU) to accelerate the stitching. How much acceleration you will get, if any, depends on the combination of video card and driver.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="I_get_a_nona:_GL_error._Does_this_mean_that_I_found_a_bug.3F"> I get a nona: GL error. Does this mean that I found a bug? </span></h3>
<p>Not necessarily. This functionality is highly experimental. It may be that you have an outdated driver, or that the functionality is not supported on your video card. Note down the version of the driver you are using and the specs of your video card (GPU and RAM). Then update to the latest driver from <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.nvidia.com/page/drivers.html">nVidia</a> or <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/Pages/index.aspx">AMD</a> (ATI has been bought by AMD). Currently only these two families of GPUs support the functionality.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="How_can_I_know_if_nona-GPU_works_on_my_system.3F"> How can I know if nona-GPU works on my system? </span></h3>
<p>At the moment we have too little information to predict this. We know that only nVidia and AMD(ATI) powered video cards work, and not all of them. The more recent the video card, the higher the likelihood that it works. Improve your chances by updating to the latest driver for your GPU. Look at experience reports from other users and report your experience here<a class="external" href="http://wiki.panotools.org/Nona_GPU_stitching_reports">[*]</a>.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="What_speed_improvement_can_I_expect.3F"> What speed improvement can I expect? </span></h3>
<p>It depends on the video card. Bandwidth is mostly the bottleneck, specifically getting the transformed data from the GPU back to the main system memory.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Bug_Reporting"> Bug Reporting </span></h3>
<p>When reporting success or failure using the GPU for stitching, always report also the driver version, video card GPU and RAM. Tell us what you were doing, the size and number of input images (note that if you stitch from within Hugin or PTBatcher, it is only one input image at a time).

<p>This will will produce a multi_layer.tif file, that contains all remapped images, cropped to their bounding box.
</p>
<ul><li> Alternatively select the <b>Remapped Images</b> option in the <a href="Hugin_Stitcher_tab.html" title="Hugin Stitcher tab">Hugin Stitcher tab</a>, this will create each <i>layer</i> as a separate file.

<p>Enblend and Enfuse can be optimized at build time for different hardware configurations. This yields four categories of Enblend-Enfuse builds, with a few variations. If you build Enblend-Enfuse from source, check the build options in the README file. If you download a binary, you can find out how it has been built with the following command:
</p>
<pre> enblend -v -V
</pre>
<p>look for the following in the output text:
</p>
<ol><li> <b>Extra feature: OpenMP: yes</b> this version has OpenMP.
</li><li> <b>Extra feature: image cache: yes</b> this version has image cache
</li><li> <b>Extra feature: GPU acceleration: yes</b> this version has GPU support
</li><li> SSE-support is not mentioned, you'll find out if you have an unsupported CPU and the binary will refuse to run.
</li></ol>
<p>These are approximate guidelines to help you choose what may work for you:
</p>
<ul><li> if you have a recent, multi-core / multi-thread CPU, you probably want the OpenMP-enabled version. Note however that speed improvement does not scale well, so don't expect a 6 cores CPU to be 3x faster than a 2 cores one.
</li><li> if you have a recent, fast video card, you probably want the GPU-enabled version.   This is not mutually exclusive with OpenMP and a good builder will add both features to his binaries.  If speed is important to you, you want to test which of the two is faster on your system.  If system responsiveness is important to you, the GPU-enabled version frees CPU resources for your other tasks.  Note that even if your binary is GPU-enabled, the GPU will not be used unless you specify the option `--gpu`.
</li><li> if you have an old CPU without SSE2 support, you want a NOSSE build.  This is the least performing version.
</li><li> Last but not least, if blending fails because of large images, try the image cache variation.  The image cache allows for processing of large project when memory is scarce but images are large (and disk is large enough too).  Image cache is incompatible with OpenMP, but a good bilder will make this version GPU-enabled too, so test it with `--gpu` if speed is important.
