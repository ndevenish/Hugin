			<p>The rest of <a href="Hugin.html" title="Hugin">hugin</a> is all about setting up the project and aligning images, the <b>Stitcher</b> tab is where
the final output file is created.
</p>
<a name="Panorama"></a><h1> <span class="mw-headline"> Panorama </span></h1>
<p>Here you can set the output <b><a href="Projections.html" title="Projections">Projection</a></b> of your project, there are lots
to choose from, each with different advantages and disadvantages:
</p>
<ul><li> <a href="Rectilinear_Projection.html" title="Rectilinear Projection">Rectilinear</a>, this is the same projection as a photo taken with a 'normal' camera and lens.  Use this if you are just stitching a handful of photographs together with a narrow <a href="Field_of_View.html" title="Field of View">Field of View</a> or <a href="Perspective_correction.html" title="Perspective correction">correcting perspective</a> in a single shot.
</li><li> <a href="Cylindrical_Projection.html" title="Cylindrical Projection">Panorama</a>, actually a simple <a href="Cylindrical_Projection.html" title="Cylindrical Projection">Cylindrical Projection</a> as used by traditional rotating panoramic cameras.  A good projection for printing a 360 degree panorama, though you may prefer <i>Mercator Projection</i>.
</li><li> <a href="Equirectangular_Projection.html" title="Equirectangular Projection">Equirectangular</a>, the all purpose format for representing an entire spherical scene.  It covers 360 degrees horizontally as well as the <a href="Zenith.html" title="Zenith">zenith</a> and <a href="Nadir.html" title="Nadir">nadir</a>.
</li><li> <a href="Fisheye_Projection.html" title="Fisheye Projection">Fisheye</a>, the same projection as a photo taken with a <i>fisheye lens</i>.  Better for representing a wide <a href="Field_of_View.html" title="Field of View">Field of View</a> than <i>rectilinear</i>, but in many cases <i>Stereographic Projection</i> gives less distortion than simple <i>fisheye</i>.
</li><li> <a href="Stereographic_Projection.html" title="Stereographic Projection">Stereographic</a>, a <i>conformal</i> fisheye image.  Objects in a stereographic image keep the same shape and show less distortion than simple <i>fisheye</i>.
</li><li> <a href="Projections.html#mercator_projection" title="Projections">Mercator</a>, a <i>conformal</i> cylindrical image.  A good projection for printing a 360 degree panorama.
</li><li> <a href="Projections.html#Transverse_mercator_projection" title="Projections">Trans Mercator</a>, a <i>mercator</i> image rotated 90 degrees, suitable for displaying tall or overhead objects.
</li><li> <a href="Projections.html#sinusoidal_projection" title="Projections">Sinusoidal</a>, an <i>equal area</i> projection of an entire spherical scene.
</li><li> Lambert Equal Area Conical
</li><li> Lambert Equal Area Azimuthal
</li><li> Albers Equal Area Conic
</li><li> Miller Cylindrical
</li><li> Panini
</li><li> Architectural
</li><li> Orthographic
</li><li> Equisolid
</li><li> Equirectangular Panini
</li></ul>
<a name="Field_of_View"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Field of View </span></h2>
<p>This is the horizontal and vertical <a href="Field_of_View.html" title="Field of View">angle of view</a> of the output image,
clicking <b>Calculate Field of View</b> will shrink or enlarge the field of view of the
output to fit the arrangement of the input images - The <b>Fit</b> button in the
<a href="Hugin_Preview_window.html" title="Hugin Preview window">Hugin Preview window</a> does the same thing.
</p><p>Note that some <a href="Projections.html" title="Projections">Projections</a> have a limited field of view, notably:
</p>
<ul><li> Rectilinear has to be less than 180 degrees both vertically and horizontally.
</li><li> Panoramic (cylindrical) has to be less than 180 degrees vertically.
</li><li> Stereographic has to be less than 360 degrees both vertically and horizontally.
</li><li> Mercator has to be less than 180 degrees vertically.
</li><li> Transverse Mercator has to be less than 180 degrees horizontally.
</li></ul>
<a name="Panorama_Canvas_Size"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Panorama Canvas Size </span></h2>
<p>Set the <b>width</b> and <b>height</b> of your output panorama in pixels.  <b>Calculate Optimal Size</b> will estimate
a size that has about the same resolution as your input images.
</p><p>Some examples: a <i>three megapixel</i> image has pixel dimensions of 2048 x 1536, an A4 print at 300 pixels per inch will
have a pixel size of 3500 x 2480, a <i>full screen</i> spherical <a href="Equirectangular_Projection.html" title="Equirectangular Projection">Equirectangular Projection</a> image will have pixel
dimensions of 6000 x 3000 or greater and a <i>gigapixel</i> image has a pixel size of 32768 x 32768.
</p><p>Note that the <a href="Interpolation.html" title="Interpolation">interpolation</a> used by <a href="Hugin.html" title="Hugin">hugin</a> doesn't handle downsampling very well, so output images smaller
than about half the size of the <i>Optimal Size</i> will show <a href="Aliasing.html" title="Aliasing">aliasing</a> artefacts.  If you want to create high quality
small images, it is better to create an <i>Optimal Size</i> image in hugin and downsize it later in an image editor such as the Gimp.
</p>
<a name="Crop"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Crop </span></h2>
<p>The crop settings allow just a portion of the panorama to be stitched, there are various reasons to do this:
</p>
<ul><li> When <a href="Perspective_correction.html" title="Perspective correction">correcting perspective</a> large areas of the panorama output will be empty anyway.
</li><li> Large 'gigapixel' style panoramas can be stitched in sections then blended later.
</li></ul>
<p>The cropped-out areas are shown darkened in the <a href="Hugin_Preview_window.html" title="Hugin Preview window">hugin Preview window</a>.
</p>
<a name="Output"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Output </span></h2>
<p>Hugin can output 'normal' stitched images, exposure blended images or high dynamic range (<a href="HDR.html" title="HDR">HDR</a>) images.
The following options determine which kind of image is created, and allow keeping the intermediate images created during the process.
</p>
<a name="Normal"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> Normal </span></h3>
<p>If <b>Blended panorama</b> is enabled then <a href="Enblend.html" title="Enblend">enblend</a> is used for blending. In the final stitching process <a href="Nona.html" title="Nona">nona</a> reprojects and distorts images to fit, <b>enblend</b> takes these images as individual <a href="TIFF.html" title="TIFF">TIFF</a> files and merges them using sophisticated seam positioning and blending.  Further <b>enblend</b> settings can be found in the <a href="Hugin_Preferences.html" title="Hugin Preferences">hugin Preferences</a>.
</p><p>Enable <b>remapped images</b> if you want to keep the intermediate images that <b>enblend</b> uses as input - For example modifying the <a href="Alpha_channel.html" title="Alpha channel">alpha channel</a> of these images and then blending manually is one technique for including and excluding people or objects that move between shots.
</p>
<a name="Exposure_Blending"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> Exposure Blending </span></h3>
<p>If <b>Blended panorama (enfuse)</b> is enabled then hugin will group the input images into exposure stacks by comparing positions and EV exposure values.  Each of these <a href="Bracketing.html" title="Bracketing">bracketed</a> exposure stacks will be exposure blended with <a href="Enfuse.html" title="Enfuse">enfuse</a> and the results stitched together into a panorama with <a href="Enblend.html" title="Enblend">enblend</a>.
</p><p>Note that for this to work, the scene has to be photographed multiple times using exposure <a href="Bracketing.html" title="Bracketing">bracketing</a> and the EV exposure values set either manually in the <a href="Hugin_Camera_and_Lens_tab.html" title="Hugin Camera and Lens tab">hugin Camera and Lens tab</a>, automatically from <a href="EXIF.html" title="EXIF">EXIF</a> data or by optimising exposure in the <a href="Hugin_Assistant_tab.html" title="Hugin Assistant tab">hugin Assistant tab</a> or <a href="Hugin_Exposure_tab.html" title="Hugin Exposure tab">hugin Exposure tab</a>.
</p><p>Note also that unlike <b>Normal</b> and <b>Merge to HDR</b> options where images are exposure corrected as part of the remapping process, enfuse requires that each exposure layer is supplied uncorrected - Hugin takes care of this automatically and will not apply correction in this case.
</p><p>Enable <b>Blended exposure layers</b> to additionally stitch each exposure layer into a  separate panorama - Useful for manual exposure blending.
</p><p>Enable <b>Remapped images</b> to keep the intermediate images supplied to <a href="Enblend.html" title="Enblend">enblend</a>.
</p>
<a name="Merge_to_HDR"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> Merge to HDR </span></h3>
<p>If <b>Blended HDR panorama</b> is enabled then hugin will identify likely <a href="Bracketing.html" title="Bracketing">bracketed</a> stacks of images, then create remapped, deghosted HDR images which are then blended with <a href="Enblend.html" title="Enblend">enblend</a>.
</p><p>Note that like the Exposure blending option above, this generally only makes sense if the scene has been photographed multiple times using exposure bracketing, and the EV exposure values optimised in the <a href="Hugin_Exposure_tab.html" title="Hugin Exposure tab">hugin Exposure tab</a>.
</p><p>Enable <b>Stacked HDR images</b> to keep copies of the remapped HDR images as supplied to enblend.
</p><p>Enable <b>Individual non merged images</b> to keep copies of each image remapped in linear colour space before deghosting and merging to HDR.
</p><p>Click <b>Stitch now!</b> to generate output panoramas immediately.  Selecting <b>Save project and send to batch</b> adds the current project to the <a href="Hugin_Batch_Processor.html" title="Hugin Batch Processor">Hugin Batch Processor</a> stitching queue, note that the queue won't be processed unless this queue manager is running.
</p>
<a name="Processing"></a><h1> <span class="mw-headline"> Processing </span></h1>
<p><a href="Nona.html" title="Nona">nona</a> is the default <b>Remapper</b> (stitching engine) supplied with <a href="Hugin.html" title="Hugin">hugin</a>, normally there is no need to
change this or any of the options below.
</p><p>Set the <b>Interpolator (i)</b> to change the sampling <a href="Interpolation.html" title="Interpolation">interpolation</a>.  You probably won't notice
much difference between the various options except that <b>Nearest Neighbour</b> is fast but with
very low quality.  The default of <b>Poly3 (bicubic)</b> is generally good for most purposes.
</p><p><a href="Cropped_TIFF.html" title="Cropped TIFF">Cropped TIFF</a> files are smaller and more efficient because unused parts of the image are not stored in the file.  You should
always <b>save cropped images</b> unless you need to open them in an image editor without <a href="Cropped_TIFF.html" title="Cropped TIFF">Cropped TIFF</a> support.
</p><p><a href="Enblend.html" title="Enblend">enblend</a> is the default <b>Blender</b> for use with <a href="Hugin.html" title="Hugin">hugin</a>, normally there is no need to change this.  Additional command-line <b>Options</b> can be set here or in the <a href="Hugin_Preferences.html" title="Hugin Preferences">hugin Preferences</a> for new projects.
</p><p><a href="Enfuse.html" title="Enfuse">enfuse</a> is the default for <b>Image fusion</b> (<b>Exposure Blending</b>), <b>Options</b> are similar to <a href="Enblend.html" title="Enblend">enblend</a>.
</p>
<a name="File_formats"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> File formats </span></h2>
<p><b>Normal Output</b> can be in one several formats:
</p>
<ul><li> <b><a href="TIFF.html" title="TIFF">TIFF</a></b>, various compression options. 16bit and <i>8bit</i> depth supported.  <b>None</b> compression is supported by most other applications, <b>LZW</b> compression is common in Windows/Mac applications and <b>Deflate</b> compression is more common with Linux tools.
</li><li> <b><a href="JPEG.html" title="JPEG">JPG</a></b>, lossy compression suitable for web/email.  <b>Quality</b> can vary from <i>0</i> (extremely low quality, small file size) and <i>100</i> (high quality, large file size).  A typical quality setting for web/email would be between <i>70</i> and <i>80</i>
</li><li> <b><a href="PNG.html" title="PNG">PNG</a></b>, lossless compression. 16bit and <i>8bit</i> depth supported.
</li><li> <b><a href="OpenEXR.html" title="OpenEXR">EXR</a></b>, not sure what use this is doing here (TODO).
</li></ul>
<p><b>HDR Output</b> can be either:
</p>
<ul><li> <i>floating-point</i> <a href="TIFF.html" title="TIFF">TIFF</a>, various compression options.
</li><li> <b><a href="OpenEXR.html" title="OpenEXR">EXR</a></b>, this is a high dynamic range format which is more compact than a high dynamic range TIFF.
</li></ul>
