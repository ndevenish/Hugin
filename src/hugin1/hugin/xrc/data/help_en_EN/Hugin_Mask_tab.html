												<!-- start content -->
			<p>The blender (default is <a href="Enblend.html" title="Enblend">Enblend</a>) uses any part of an photo overlap to place a seam which can result in part of a person or object being cut by the seam and only appearing in part in the final stitch.
</p><p>By excluding an area using a mask (exclude mask) you are telling the blender to exclude
that region from consideration both when placing the seam and when
blending. The result is that you can remove a person or object from the final stitch. You should only exclude part of one photo if some other photo shows the same part of the scene without that object.
</p><p>When you include an object with a mask (include mask) the opposite happens, this simply removes that part of the scene from all other photos, the blender then has no choice but to use the region in the photo you selected.
</p><p>Masks can be saved and reloaded.
</p><p>The left side of the mask window shows a list of all images in the current project. 
The list box below shows all masks of the active image.

<a name="Creating_mask_polygon" id="Creating_mask_polygon"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> Creating mask polygon </span></h3>
<p>After selecting <b>add new mask</b> set polygon points with left mouse click. Finish polygon with right mouse button or left double

</p>
<a name="Deleting_a_mask" id="Deleting_a_mask"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> Deleting a mask </span></h3>

pressing the delete key when all or none points of the current mask are selected.
</p>
<a name="Select_mask" id="Select_mask"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> Select mask </span></h3>
<p>There are 3 ways to select a mask
</p>
<ul><li> left mouse click inside polygon
</li><li> use rubberband around polygon, this works only when the active polygon has no selected points
</li><li> use the listbox on the left side
</li></ul>
<a name="Selecting_point.28s.29" id="Selecting_point.28s.29"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> Selecting point(s) </span></h3>
<p>You can select points of the active polygon by clicking on it. To select several points use a rubberband around all points. When holding down the shift key, the newly selected points are added to the existing selection.
</p>
<a name="Move_point.28s.29" id="Move_point.28s.29"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> Move point(s) </span></h3>
<p>Simply drag a point with left mouse button. This works also when more then one point is selected.
</p>
<a name="Move_whole_mask" id="Move_whole_mask"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> Move whole mask </span></h3>
<p>If you want to move the whole mask, drag the mask with right mouse button. (You have to start dragging inside the polygon.)
</p>
<a name="Adding_points" id="Adding_points"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> Adding points </span></h3>
<p>You can add a new point to the mask polygon by click with left mouse button while holding down the ctrl key on a line segment. Until you release the left mouse button you can also directly move the newly created point.
</p>
<a name="Deleting_points" id="Deleting_points"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> Deleting points </span></h3>
<p>You can delete a single point of the active polygon by a right mouse click while holding ctrl key on a point. To delete multiple points drag a rectangle/rubberband with the right mouse button and pressed ctrl key around the points, which should be deleted. When you press the delete key the selected points are deleted.
</p><p>Attention: When the remaining polygon consists of less than tree points, the delete operation is canceled.
